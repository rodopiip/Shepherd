Shepherd is an innovative mobile service, designed as an assistant for individuals with ADHD. Our mission is to provide a user-friendly application that supports time management, task organization, and access to mental health resources, fostering an environment that enables focus, productivity, and wellbeing.

## Alpha Release

Our Alpha release is planned for Q3 2023, which will provide early testers a first look at the core features of Shepherd. This release is intended to be used for testing purposes to identify bugs and gather user feedback for improvements.
